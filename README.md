## Introduction

In modern PHP applications, especially those built with Symfony, managing data flow between different layers can be complex. DTOs serve as a bridge between your application and its data storage. This bundle simplifies the process of transforming data between these layers, ensuring your application remains clean and maintainable.

## Features

- **Attribute-based Mapping**: Use PHP attributes to define mappings directly in your DTOs.
- **Seamless Integration**: Works effortlessly with Symfony and Doctrine.
- **Easy Configuration**: Minimal setup required to get started.
- **Flexible**: Supports custom value transformers for complex mappings.
- **High Performance**: Built with performance in mind, using the Structured Mapper library.

## Installation

To install the Symfony Structured Mapper Bundle, you can use Composer. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
composer require sajidirnd/symfony-structured-mapper-bundle
```

After installation, ensure to enable the bundle in your `config/bundles.php` file:

```php
return [
    // Other bundles...
    Sajidirnd\SymfonyStructuredMapperBundle\SajidirndSymfonyStructuredMapperBundle::class => ['all' => true],
];
```

## Usage

To start using the Symfony Structured Mapper Bundle, you need to create your DTOs and Entities. The bundle allows you to define mappings directly within your DTOs using attributes.

### Example DTO

```php
namespace App\DTO;

use Sajidirnd\SymfonyStructuredMapperBundle\Attribute\MapTo;

class UserDTO
{
    #[MapTo('name')]
    public string $fullName;

    #[MapTo('email')]
    public string $emailAddress;

    #[MapTo('age')]
    public int $age;
}
```

### Example Entity

```php
namespace App\Entity;

class User
{
    private string $name;
    private string $email;
    private int $age;

    // Getters and setters...
}
```

## Configuration

You can customize the behavior of the bundle through your Symfony configuration files. The default configuration should suffice for most use cases, but advanced options are available.

### Example Configuration

In your `config/packages/symfony_structured_mapper.yaml`:

```yaml
symfony_structured_mapper:
    # Custom configuration options
    value_transformers:
        # Define your custom transformers here
```

## Examples

Here are some common use cases for the Symfony Structured Mapper Bundle:

### Mapping DTO to Entity

To map a DTO to an Entity, you can use the `Mapper` service provided by the bundle:

```php
use App\DTO\UserDTO;
use App\Entity\User;
use Sajidirnd\SymfonyStructuredMapperBundle\Service\Mapper;

class UserService
{
    private Mapper $mapper;

    public function __construct(Mapper $mapper)
    {
        $this->mapper = $mapper;
    }

    public function createUser(UserDTO $userDTO): User
    {
        $user = new User();
        $this->mapper->map($userDTO, $user);
        return $user;
    }
}
```

### Mapping Entity to DTO

Similarly, you can map an Entity back to a DTO:

```php
public function getUserDTO(User $user): UserDTO
{
    $userDTO = new UserDTO();
    $this->mapper->map($user, $userDTO);
    return $userDTO;
}
```
